Winter's a-coming
There's snow on the bank
The money is frozen
Gotta fill up the tank
I ain't got far to drive
But it's when I come back
Wasting days up to midnight
Tryin' to find my jack

The wind on my window
Keeps me up, I think
The dreams I make are
Starting to shrink
The fire is gone
Was it here at all?
There's no second exit
It left by the hall

I see Mother Mary
On top of the door
Of course she carries
Her name like a horse
She's been going around
Looking for the fire
Nothing was found
Except the shame of desire

The air is heavy
The walls are thin
Don't quit the breathing
Just take me in
I've been going around
Trading fire for fuel
I can't afford to sell
I've got nothing to duel

I don't play with cards
I just play with aces
If they're not dealt right
I won't remember faces

You can steal from my pockets
You can eat off my bones
No heat, no love
No direction home

(I don't play with cards
